# Pet Card UI Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. "Get Pet" CTA Instead of "Not Connected"
- âœ… Changed text from "Not Connected" to "Get Pet"
- âœ… Made text primary color and bold for better visibility
- âœ… Made the entire Pet card clickable when no pet is connected
- âœ… Clicking navigates to `/connect-pet` setup flow

### 2. No Loading State Display
- âœ… Added `devicesLoading` state to track loading
- âœ… Pet card shows nothing while loading (no "Not Connected" flash)
- âœ… Only shows content after loading completes
- âœ… Smooth fade-in animation when content appears

### 3. Pet Data Caching
- âœ… Implemented localStorage caching with key `pet-device-${userId}`
- âœ… Cached data loads instantly on page load
- âœ… Fresh data fetched in background and updates cache
- âœ… Cache is user-specific (different cache for each activeUserId)

### 4. Fade-in Animation
- âœ… Added CSS keyframe animation `fadeIn`
- âœ… 0.5s smooth fade-in when pet appears
- âœ… Applied to both "has pet" and "no pet" states

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `app/profile/page.tsx`
   - Added `devicesLoading` state
   - Implemented localStorage caching in `fetchConnectedDevices()`
   - Made Pet card a clickable Button
   - Added conditional rendering based on loading state
   - Added fade-in animation classes

2. `app/globals.css`
   - Added `@keyframes fadeIn` animation
   - Added `.animate-fade-in` utility class

### Cache Strategy
```typescript
const cacheKey = `pet-device-${userId}`;

// Load from cache immediately
const cached = localStorage.getItem(cacheKey);
if (cached) {
  setConnectedDevices(JSON.parse(cached).devices);
  setDevicesLoading(false);
}

// Fetch fresh data in background
const response = await fetch(`/api/device/list?activeUserId=${userId}`);
localStorage.setItem(cacheKey, JSON.stringify({ devices: data.devices }));
```

### UX Flow
1. **Page loads** â†’ Pet card shows only "Pet" label (no content)
2. **Cache hit** â†’ Pet fades in instantly from cache
3. **API returns** â†’ Updates cache and UI if data changed
4. **No pet** â†’ "Get Pet" button fades in, clickable
5. **Has pet** â†’ Pet avatar and name fade in, button disabled

## Benefits
- âš¡ **Instant loading** - Cached data appears immediately
- ðŸŽ¨ **Better UX** - No flash of "Not Connected" text
- ðŸ”˜ **Clear CTA** - "Get Pet" is more actionable than "Not Connected"
- âœ¨ **Smooth animations** - Professional fade-in effect
- ðŸ’¾ **Reduced API calls** - Cache minimizes redundant requests
