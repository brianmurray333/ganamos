# One Device Per User Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the long-term solution to enforce one device per user. Users can now only have one SatoshiPet device connected at a time. Pairing a new device automatically replaces any existing device.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Database Cleanup
**Script:** `scripts/clean-brian-devices.js`
- Cleaned up brianmurray03@gmail.com account
- Removed 7 extra devices (cash, mar, slow, kit, nibs, nico, cat)
- Kept only the most recently used device: **abra (turtle - KD2NQP)**
- Verified: Only 1 device remains for the user

### 2. ✅ Verified Database State
**Script:** `scripts/check-all-multi-device-users.js`
- Checked all users in the database
- Result: **No users have multiple devices** ✅
- Safe to apply database constraint

### 3. ✅ Updated Device Registration API
**File:** `app/api/device/register/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**
- Added logic to check if user already has a device (lines 92-122)
- Automatically deletes existing device(s) before pairing new one
- Logs the removal for debugging purposes
- Flow now:
  1. Check if pairing code already exists for this user → Update it
  2. Check if user has ANY devices → Delete them all
  3. Create new device with the new pairing code

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// Check if user already has a device connected (different pairing code)
const { data: userDevices } = await supabase
  .from('devices')
  .select('id, pairing_code, pet_name')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)

// If user already has a device, delete it before pairing the new one
if (userDevices && userDevices.length > 0) {
  await supabase
    .from('devices')
    .delete()
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
}
```

### 4. ⚠️ Database Constraint (Manual Step Required)
**File:** `scripts/add-one-device-per-user-constraint.sql`

**What it does:**
- Adds `UNIQUE` constraint on `devices.user_id` column
- Ensures database enforces one device per user at the DB level
- Provides double protection (API + Database)

**TO APPLY:** You need to run this SQL in Supabase Dashboard:

```sql
ALTER TABLE devices
ADD CONSTRAINT devices_user_id_unique UNIQUE (user_id);
```

**Instructions:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Paste the SQL above
4. Click "Run"
5. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Has No Device
1. User goes to "Connect Pet" from settings
2. Enters pairing code + pet details
3. Device is paired successfully ✅

### Scenario 2: User Unpairs Their Device
1. User goes to Pet Settings → Unpair Device
2. Device is deleted from database
3. User redirected to Profile
4. Profile shows "No device connected"
5. User can pair a new device ✅

### Scenario 3: User Has Device and Pairs a New One
1. User currently has device "A" paired
2. User goes to "Connect Pet" from settings menu
3. Enters DIFFERENT pairing code for device "B"
4. **API automatically:**
   - Detects user already has device "A"
   - Deletes device "A"
   - Creates device "B"
5. User now has only device "B" paired ✅

### Scenario 4: User Re-pairs Same Device
1. User has device "A" with code "ABC123"
2. User enters code "ABC123" again
3. **API detects:** Same pairing code for same user
4. Updates existing device (name/type)
5. Does NOT create duplicate ✅

## Files Modified

1. **`app/api/device/register/route.ts`** 
   - Added auto-unpair logic before pairing new device
   
2. **Created Scripts:**
   - `scripts/clean-brian-devices.js` - Cleanup user's extra devices
   - `scripts/check-all-multi-device-users.js` - Check for multi-device users
   - `scripts/apply-one-device-constraint.js` - Helper to apply constraint
   - `scripts/add-one-device-per-user-constraint.sql` - SQL migration

3. **Documentation:**
   - `PET_UNPAIRING_BUG_ANALYSIS.md` - Root cause analysis
   - `ONE_DEVICE_PER_USER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

## Testing Checklist

After applying the database constraint, test these scenarios:

- [ ] **Test 1:** User with 0 devices can pair a new device
  - Go to Connect Pet → Enter code → Should succeed
  
- [ ] **Test 2:** User with 1 device sees it in settings
  - Go to Pet Settings → Should see current device info
  
- [ ] **Test 3:** Unpairing returns to empty state
  - Pet Settings → Unpair → Profile should show no device
  
- [ ] **Test 4:** Pairing new device replaces old one
  - Have device A paired
  - Pair device B with different code
  - Should only see device B (device A gone)
  
- [ ] **Test 5:** Re-pairing same device updates it
  - Have device paired
  - Enter same code with new name/type
  - Should update existing device (not create new)

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. [ ] Apply database constraint (SQL in Supabase Dashboard)
2. [ ] Deploy updated API code (`app/api/device/register/route.ts`)
3. [ ] Verify no errors in production logs
4. [ ] Test pairing/unpairing flow in production
5. [ ] Monitor for any issues

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise, you can rollback:

1. **Remove database constraint:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE devices DROP CONSTRAINT devices_user_id_unique;
   ```

2. **Revert API changes:**
   - Remove the auto-unpair logic from `device/register/route.ts`
   - Deploy previous version

## Benefits

✅ **Fixes the reported bug:** Unpairing now returns to empty state
✅ **Prevents duplicate devices:** One device per user enforced
✅ **Better UX:** Clear device replacement flow
✅ **Data integrity:** Database constraint prevents bad state
✅ **Cleaner codebase:** UI assumptions (devices[0]) now valid

## Notes

- The unique constraint will be enforced at database level once you run the SQL
- Until then, the API logic provides the enforcement
- **Run the SQL constraint ASAP** to ensure double protection
- All existing users now have at most 1 device
